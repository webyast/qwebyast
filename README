QWebYaST Applet
---------------

This is a Qt based desktop applet for controlling WebYaST on the local machine.
(Although based on QT it can be used also in other desktops like GNOME...)

It can start or stop WebYaST instance on the local machine or open WebYaST in a web browser.

It is intended for users who want to use WebYaST on the local machine but do not want to
keep it running all the time and just start it when needed.
